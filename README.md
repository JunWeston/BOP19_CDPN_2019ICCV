# BOP19_CDPN_2019ICCV (PBR version)

A modified CDPN version for BOP19/20 challenge (based on "CDPN: Coordinates-Based Disentangled Pose Network for Real-Time RGB-Based 6-DoF Object Pose Estimation" on ICCV 2019).

In this repo, the method stays the same as Zhigang-CDPN-ICCV19 in BOP Challenge 2019. For LMO, HB, ICBIN and ITODD datasets, only PBR images provided for BOP Challenge 2020 were used during training. For YCBV, TUD and TLESS datasets, both PBR images provided for BOP Challenge 2020 and real images provided for BOP Challenge 2019 were used during training.

** The CDPN weights trained with PBR data will be provided soon!**
